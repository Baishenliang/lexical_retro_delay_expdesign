# Latency testing for Cogan lab task scripts
   
The load intan scripts were downloaded from the intan websites.   
*bsliang_process_demo_phonemeseq_originalscript.ipynb*: processing notebook for the original scripts.   
*bsliang_process_demo_phonemeseq_newbuff.ipynb*: processing notebook for the updated (used a new load buffer strategy) scripts.   
*bsliang_process_demo_Retrocue.ipynb*: processing notebook for the Retrocue task.   

*Note*  
1. Intan recorded data (from microphone and photo to the intan) are stored in:  Box\CoganLab\IndividualMeetings\Baishen. Change the direction to reorient to the Box.  
2. Run the notebook in Python 3.12.5, or just install the environment of the big repository.  
3. For task scripts, see the Phoneme sequencing repository in Cogan lab github: phoneme_sequencing_revised2018_bsl_clicklatency.m for the original scripts, and phoneme_sequencing_revised2018_bsl_clicklatency_newbuffer.m for the updated scripts (but we do not adopt this).
